# QuickCanvas

Lean Canvas was created by Ash Maurya by adaptating the Business Model Canvas by Alexander Osterwalder as described in his book ["Business Model Generation"](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com). 

This adaptation is more focused on how business models should be generated in the Lean Startup spirit.

Lean Canvas is an actionable and compact business plan format, based on problems, solutions, key metrics and competitive advantages. 

While the structure is similar to the well-known Business Model Canvas, the sections headings have been exchanged to something
more relevant to the Lean Startup and web-based app startups in general. 

The author describes the Lean Canvas and the ideas behind it on his website's [Why Lean Canvas](http://leancanvas.com/blog/why-lean-canvas-vs-business-model-canvas) page.
